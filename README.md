Unity Flipbook Motion Blending
===

This repository contains a flipbook motion blending shader for Unity.

I am using this to test my upcoming tool that generates motion vectors from flipbook frames rendered in tools that lack motion vector export features.

This is an early prototype and can be used as a reference implementation. However, the shader lacks various features, such as support for Shuriken custom vertex streams.

Motion vector textures can be generated using Houdini or my upcoming tool.
